## Design approach:
- Concept + Rationale (of purpose, + app layout e.g. widget similar to apple)
- Mobile-first approach + reasoning
- Breakpoint + reasoning

## Installing MUI + React
To make the coding experince more simple design elements more fluid to one another, I employed the help of installing React.js, as well as MUI to the code. I then moved on to customising the default values and themens to fit my Figma prototype. This was done in the root ```src/component/styleSheet.js``` file. I created a theme const and edited the properties of the original theme I wanted to adjust.

## Design system:
### Typography (font + sizing, account for different screen sizes)
For the choice of font, I decided to stick with the default MUI theme, the font was already accurate the the visual portray of the website I had originally had in mind. I chose to edit the sizing of the elements, however, as I felt that the given hierachy was more suited to longer websites that needed to utilise multiple different headers under headers, which this "widget function" system did not require. As such, I edited the text sizes I will be utilising below:

| First Header  | Mobile ( MUI"xs") | Desktop (MUI "md")| 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|    Heading    | 1.5 rem  | 2 rem  |
|   Paragraph   | 1 rem  | 1.5 rem  |
|    Caption    | 0.5 rem  | 1 rem  |

### Colour palette (colour palette, choices + does it meet accessibility guidelines)
dd

### Formatting (Spacing + border guidelines)

## High-fidelity
- Talk about any changes from mid --> high

(for features, talk about how similar / any changes you had to do from your wireframe to coding, was it ease? Using tool? if tool, reference them)

## Constructing HTML
-CSS Reset: To make sure that there are no inconsistencies across different browsers, I used a "Reset CSS" by _ (https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) to work on a clean slate.

## Constructing CSS
- Mention creating variables for e.g. breakpoints + colours, font sizing
- CSS grid? (https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/)
- Responsive layout

## Javascript implementations:
- Feature: Exercise logger (storing previous data)
- Feature: protein intake (adding pervious data + updating goals)
- Feature: Exercise Checklist (Checklist + remove all inputted data button)
- Feature: BW tracker (graph + average)

- Function: Saving user data

- Any outstanding features (what couldn't you code? and why?)
- Next steps (if you had more time/experience, what would you do? e.g. animate graph on reset of widget)
