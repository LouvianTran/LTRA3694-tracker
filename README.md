## High-fidelity
- Talk about any changes from mid --> high

(for features, talk about how similar / any changes you had to do from your wireframe to coding, was it ease? Using tool? if tool, reference them)

___

## Constructing HTML
-CSS Reset: To make sure that there are no inconsistencies across different browsers, I used a "Reset CSS" by _ (https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) to work on a clean slate.

## Constructing CSS
- Mention creating variables for e.g. breakpoints + colours, font sizing
- CSS grid? (https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/)
- Responsive layout

## Javascript implementations:
- Feature: Exercise logger (storing previous data)
- Feature: protein intake (adding pervious data + updating goals)
- Feature: Exercise Checklist (Checklist + remove all inputted data button)
- Feature: BW tracker (graph + average)

- Function: Saving user data

- Any outstanding features (what couldn't you code? and why?)
- Next steps (if you had more time/experience, what would you do? e.g. animate graph on reset of widget)
